# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a good way to reference back to when doing future course work.
These are building blocks for a foundation that I can always look back on in case I forget anything.
I prepares me for the next steps during class while also exposing me to many elements and ways of thinking.
I learned of how to debug code that I have written, and how to search for the information I need through outside help. I have also learned that sometimes you will find other problems within your code that is not told in the course work and that is where it is important to know how to find that information from other sources is important. Also, learning how to reverse code from other people's projects is a extremely good way to learn. Questions like "what does this line do?" or "how is this one function programmed?" are such great ways to find building blocks for your personal project. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

It contains a study guide that may or may not be used and could be added onto if needed. The more important aspect is that this can be referenced back to during course work to find code that I otherwise would not have remembered.
